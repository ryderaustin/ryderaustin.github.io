    <p>Contrast Checker
    </p>
    <p>For this assignment I did the contrast checker to ensure it passed via https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/. The score I receieved was 9.54:1 which surpasses the 3:1 and 4.5:1 standards. I did need to update the header color to white as it was not passing with the original contrast being 1.31:1. I can use this information if I ever do create or modify any website I can run it through the website https://wave.webaim.org and verify in what specifically needs correction.

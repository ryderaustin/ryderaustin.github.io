    <p>This session taught me about internet security and personally identifiable information (PII). PII includes any information that can identify a person, and its protection has become crucial with technological advancements and the widespread use of the internet, raising concerns about privacy and security. Unauthorized access to PII can lead to crimes such as identity theft or stalking. Organizations must take robust measures to safeguard people's PII, including establishing strict privacy rules and complying with relevant laws. It is vital for organizations to stay updated on what constitutes personal information and how to keep it secure, reflecting the evolving regulatory landscape. 

        Regarding network security, I learned about various threats like viruses, worms, botnets, spyware, rootkits, and adware, which directly infect computers. To combat these threats, antivirus software provides essential protection by preventing these programs from accessing your system. Additionally, I gained insight into different types of firewalls. A Packet Filter firewall checks data packets based on simple rules about their origin and destination. Stateful Packet Inspection firewalls not only examine each packet but also track connections, allowing only legitimate traffic. Application-Level Gateways are advanced firewalls that inspect entire messages, ensuring safety for specific applications like email or web browsing and hiding your computer's address from external networks. 
        
         
        
        Use anti-malware software to scan your system and test malware detection 
        
        For this task, I used Windows Defender to scan my system. After checking out a few other free antivirus programs, I found that Windows Defender is one of the best. Since I schedule weekly scans and do not download much, I was not expecting any problems. When I tested it with the EICAR file, Windows Defender detected it no problem. I can use this professionally and personally to make sure my antivirus is working if I ever have doubts. Plus, I do not need to spend money on fancy antivirus software because Windows Defender is free and one of the best.

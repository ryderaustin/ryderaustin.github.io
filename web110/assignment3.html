In one of the Email activities, it instructed me on how to send an email. While this is an item I already know â€“ I did this activity to see if there were any basics I may have forgotten. I use email on a day-to-day basis to work with clients, so I use this in my current environment.  

 

The second activity I performed was reviewing e-mail headers and learning about email spoofing.  It is when someone sends an email that looks like it is from someone else. This can trick people into opening spam, phishing, or ransomware emails. The old email systems did not have ways to check if the sender was real, making it easy to fake addresses. Even with new protections, spoofing still happens, especially inside company networks. People and businesses can be tricked into losing money and getting their computers infected with harmful software. In my current environment, our IT team sends spoofing tests randomly to ensure we are aware of it. Though it is obvious, it is still crucial to keep the company and employees safe. 

 

For the social networking activity, I chose to do the activity that interests me. I was informed about some social media sites I was not aware of such as Ibibo, Flickr, Line, and Hike. I looked at some videos of how they work and it is interesting.  The current ones I use from the list are Facebook and LinkedIn. Faceparty I thought would be a lookalike Facebook, but it looks closer related to Myspace. I can use social media in my current environment to look for tech jobs once I finish my AAS and certifications.

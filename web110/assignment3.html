Assignment 3 

 

Send, receive, and respond to email  

In one of the Email activities, it instructed me on how to send an email. While this is an item I already know â€“ I did this activity to see if there were any basics I may have forgotten. I use email on a day-to-day basis to work with clients, so I use this in my current environment. I learned how e-mails are sent or transmitted. An email program (mail user agent) sends the email to its outbound mail server using the SMTP protocol. The outbound mail server then looks up the domain name of the recipient's email address to find the appropriate destination mail server using DNS MX records. It sends the email to the destination mail server via SMTP. Finally, the destination mail server places the email in the recipient's mailbox. The recipient retrieves the email from their mailbox using either the POP or IMAP protocol. 

 

View email message headers 

The second activity I performed was reviewing e-mail headers and learning about email spoofing. It is when someone sends an email that looks like it is from someone else. This can trick people into opening spam, phishing, or ransomware emails. The old email systems did not have ways to check if the sender was real, making it easy to fake addresses. Even with new protections, spoofing still happens, especially inside company networks. People and businesses can be tricked into losing money and getting their computers infected with harmful software. In my current environment, our IT team sends spoofing tests randomly to ensure we are aware of it. Though it is obvious, it is still crucial to keep the company and employees safe. 

 

Complete the tutorial Tutorials Point: Social Networking 

For the social networking activity, I chose to do the activity that interests me. I was informed about some social media sites I was not aware of such as: Ibibo, Flickr, Line, and Hike. I looked at some videos of how they work, and it is interesting. The current ones I use from the list are Facebook and LinkedIn. Faceparty I thought would be a lookalike Facebook, but it looks closer related to Myspace. I can use social media in my current environment to look for tech jobs once I finish my AAS and certifications. 

 

 

FTP 

For the communications activity, I chose to understand more about the File transfer protocol. There are three primary ways to use FTP which are anonymous access, Password-protected, and Secure. It instructed me how to use FTP through browsers anonymously and with login information. I currently use SFTP in my work environment to transmit reports from clients to vendors. I learned the SFTP is not really an FTP as it works off a Shell rather than port-based. The main differences are Connection Security, required connections, File and Directory Listings and Operations, Authentication, and Server Requirements.

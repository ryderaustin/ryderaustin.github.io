    <p>The first lesson in this course introduced me to the internet basics and Git. It outlined the basics of IP/TCP known as the Internet protocol suite. The internet works based on web browsers which is a client-server application and exchanges information in HTTP. The data is routed to specific computers via an IP address, made up of fixed-length numbers housed in the packet. Instead of users entering the IP address to access websites this information is translated automatically via a domain name such as ‘google.com.’ IPv4 is the original system for IP addresses, using 32-bit numbers, but it ran out of addresses because the Internet grew so fast. To fix this, IPv6 was created using 128-bit numbers, which means a lot more addresses. However, IPv6 is not directly compatible with IPv4, so special tools or dual software are needed to bridge the two. Onto Git, Git is a distributed version control system that tracks versions of files. It is used to control source code by programmers working together to develop software. Git allows developers to easily create branches, merge changes, and view the entire project history. Each developer has a complete copy of the project and ensures all changes are secure and trackable. It shares code using various methods like HTTPS, FTP, and SSH. Git automatically cleans up unused data and compresses files to save space. It tracks changes to the whole project rather than individual files making it a strong tool for code management.  

        Activity 3: Complete the following Wiki How tutorial 
        
        This document instructed me on how to save, copy, and organize documents. Most of this information I already knew and used the activity just to double-check my knowledge on the basics. While I am a PC over Mac user, I did learn how to create a backup on a Mac since I never owned one. I can use this activity to remember that in a career it will not be items I am familiar with. I will need to extend my knowledge of Mac and others I am not too familiar with to help prepare me for a job in the tech industry.  
        
        Activity 6:  Tracing Internet Traffic 
        
        This activity instructed me on how to use the traceroute command. This was used in the command module to see how many hops it takes to go from my IP address to another such as Google. It took 8 hops to reach Google and I received an asterisk during one of the packets sent. After further research, I learned that an asterisk means it was lost or not delivered. I can use this knowledge in the future if I am not able to connect to specific websites to see where the issue is occurring in the path.

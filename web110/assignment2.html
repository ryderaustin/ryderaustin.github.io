    <p>During session two I learned about web browsers and search engines. A web browser retrieves content from the Web or local storage and displays it on the user's device. This process begins when the user inputs a URL, typically starting with http: or https:. URLs starting with https: ensure secure data transfer through encryption between the browser and web server. When using a web browser you can access web pages. Browsers use an internal cache to store web page resources like large images, improving loading times for subsequent visits. Web pages usually contain hyperlinks to other pages and resources. While browsing, cookies from websites are stored by the browser. Cookies store login credentials or site preferences, while others track user behavior over time. While this may be a privacy concern, browsers provide a menu section for deleting cookies. More detailed cookie management typically requires browser extensions. A search engine is something that lies in a web browser. It is a software system that delivers links to web pages and other relevant information based on a user's query. When a user types a query into a web browser the search engine returns a list of hyperlinks, often accompanied by summaries and images. Users can also filter their search to focus on specific types of results, such as images, videos, or news. A search engine operates by web crawling, indexing, and searching. During web crawling, automated programs called spiders visit websites, check for the robots.txt file to understand crawling permissions, and gather data from web pages. This data is then indexed, meaning words and tokens found on pages are associated with their respective domains and HTML fields in a public database. When a user submits a query, the search engine uses this index to quickly find relevant information, returning a list of hyperlinks with summaries and images. Search results can be refined using filters and Boolean operators to improve accuracy and relevance. 

        This activity required me to install four new web browsers and compare them. Edge comes preloaded with Windows by default, so there was no need to install that one. I have used Chrome, Firefox, and Opera in the past. The Brave browser was interesting since it resembled Opera in the UI. The unique thing about the Brave browser was its built-in ad blocker, which reopened to where you left off by default. The built-in ad blocker made browsing a tad slower, but I went to YouTube and Twitch where ads are very common, and received none, nor experienced any weird delay or transition. In contrast, traditional ad blocker extensions in Chrome/Firefox would show a black screen or loading bar, ‘blocking the ad’ but not actually removing the wait time.

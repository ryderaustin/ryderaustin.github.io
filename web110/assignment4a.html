    <p>Computer networks are used to communicate and share resources in today's digital world. They allow us to use email, messaging apps, video calls, and more, making communication faster and more efficient. Networks also allow us to share devices like printers and storage drives among multiple computers. Networks are packet-switching technology, meaning data is broken down into packets before being sent over the network. Each packet includes the data being transmitted but also important details like where it came from and where it is supposed to go. This method of data transmission optimizes bandwidth usage and ensures reliable delivery of information. Networks can be set up in different configurations known as topologies. For example, a bus topology connects all computers along a single central line, like how the original Ethernet worked. A star topology, on the other hand, connects each computer to a central hub or switch. Each topology has its advantages and trade-offs in terms of cost, scalability, and resilience to failures. Physically, networks can be wired using technologies like fiber optics, coaxial cables, or twisted pair cables. Fiber optics, for instance, use light to transmit data, which allows for very high-speed and reliable connections over long distances. Wireless technologies, such as Wi-Fi and cellular networks, use radio waves to connect devices without the need for physical cables, providing flexibility and mobility. Computer networks are crucial for modern communication and resource sharing. They employ efficient data transmission methods, diverse network topologies, and both wired and wireless technologies to meet our increasing demands for connectivity, speed, and reliability. As technology advances, networks continue to evolve, supporting everything from personal communication to global-scale data transfer and collaboration. 

        Research and compare license and support costs for Windows, macOS, and Linux. 
        
        Windows usually requires a license fee for each device on which it is installed, with costs varying depending on the edition (such as Home, Pro, or Enterprise) and whether it is for personal or business use. Microsoft provides support for Windows through various channels, including updates, patches, and customer service. Updates are typically included in the initial purchase cost for individual users, while enterprise users may incur additional fees for extended support and maintenance. 
        
        macOS, developed by Apple, is typically bundled with Apple hardware (Mac computers), so users do not need to pay a separate license fee. Apple provides updates and support for macOS at no extra charge, typically including updates with the purchase of new Mac hardware. Support is available through Apple's service centers and online resources. 
        
        Linux distributions (distros) are open-source and can be freely downloaded and used. There are numerous distributions available, each tailored to different requirements (such as Ubuntu, CentOS, or Debian). Support for Linux varies widely depending on the distribution and the level of support needed. Many Linux distributions offer community-driven support forums and documentation free of charge. For enterprise users or organizations needing professional support, commercial Linux vendors provide paid support contracts that may include services such as updates, patches, and technical assistance.  </p>
